# Main Menu Background

Enhance your game menu with animated/static background. 
This mod lets you easily load GIFs and custom images, 
and adjust settings like scale and position right in-game.

I recommend you to explore mod settings. For example the "Hide Game" stands for hiding icons, "Setup Mode" adds menu to easier controlling of advanced settings.
